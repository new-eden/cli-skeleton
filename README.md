# CLI Skeleton
Use this skeleton to get a quick start on writing CLI applications - for EVE or other things!

# Requirements
- Redis
- MongoDB
- cURL
Altho `Redis` and `MongoDB` can both be removed from the requirements if you so please.

# Install and use
Run this command from the directory wherein you want to install the CLI Application

```php composer.phar create-project new-eden/cli-skeleton [my-cli-app-name]```

Replace `[my-cli-app-name]` with your desired name for the application you're making.

To run the application you can do it with either

`php bin/Run`
or
`php composer.phar start`

That's it, go build something cool!
